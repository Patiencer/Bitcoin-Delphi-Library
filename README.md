# Bitcoin-Delphi-Library
A Bitcoin library for Delphi

This library tries to use Bitcoin RPC communication for BlockChain analysis so you need to have bitcoind.exe client running and the blockchain available.

Take a look for the new component at: https://github.com/SoftwareTools4Makers/Delphi-Component-for-BlockChain-Dat-Files

this is deprecated because is better to parse blockchain files than use RPC calls....
